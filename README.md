YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing
Introduction
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that leverages the power of the Google API to extract valuable information from YouTube channels. The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database, subsequently migrated to a SQL data warehouse, and made accessible for analysis and exploration within the Streamlit app.

Perform queries on the SQL data warehouse.
Gain insights into channel performance, video metrics, and more.
Retrieving Data from the YouTube API
The project utilizes the Google API to retrieve comprehensive data from YouTube channels. The data includes information on channels, playlists, videos, and comments. By interacting with the Google API, we collect the data and merge it into a JSON file.

Storing Data in MongoDB
The retrieved data is stored in a MongoDB database based on user authorization. If the data already exists in the database, it can be overwritten with user consent. This storage process ensures efficient data management and preservation, allowing for seamless handling of the collected data.

Migrating Data to a SQL Data Warehouse
The application allows users to migrate data from MongoDB to a SQL data warehouse. Users can choose which channel's data to migrate. To ensure compatibility with a structured format, the data is cleansed using the powerful pandas library. Following data cleaning, the information is segregated into separate tables, including channels, playlists, videos, and comments, utilizing SQL queries.

Data Analysis
The project provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities using Streamlit. The Streamlit app offers an intuitive interface to interact with the data, allowing users to customize visualizations, filter data, and explore insights. Although Plotly was initially mentioned, it is not used in the current version of the project.
